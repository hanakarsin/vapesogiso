You need to be informed as to the antecedents and how the liability arose.</p><p>“Now, the liability or judgment debts related to Paris Club was indeed a liability created by the Governors Forum in their own right. How do I mean? The Governors Forum comprising all the governors sat down, commonly agreed on the engagement of consultants to provide certain services for them relating to the recovery of the Paris Club. So, it was the Governors Forum, under the Federal Government in the first place that engaged the consultants.</p><p>“Two, when eventually successes were recorded associated with the refund, the governors collectively and individually presented a request to the federal government for the fund. And among the components of the claim presented for the consideration of the federal government was a component related to the payment of these consultants that are now constituting the subject of contention.</p><p>‘’So, the implication of that is that the governors in their own right recognized the consultants, recognized their claim and presented such a claim to the federal government.”</p><p>He explained that when the claims were eventually processed and paid to the NGF, the forum, without the FG’s intervention, made part-payments to the consultants, acknowledging their liability over the same.</p><p>The AGF noted that the governors later halted payment to the contractors, causing them to drag the forum to court.</p><p>Malami further stated, “And what happened in court? They submitted to a consent judgment. They asked and urged the court to allow them settle out of court. They committed to terms of settlement in writing, they signed the terms of settlement, agreeing and conceding that such payments be made to the consultants.</p><p>“The FG under the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari was requested to comply with the judgment and effect payment. The President passed all the requests of the governors to the Office of the Attorney General for consideration.</p><p>“I suggested to the President on the face value of the judgment and the undertones associated with the consultancy services, it was my opinion, the same treatment we meted to P&ID, that ‘let us subject this claim, the consent judgment to investigation by the agencies of the government.’</p><p>“Mr President approved; I directed the EFCC and DSS to look into these claims and report back to the office of the Attorney-General. And these agencies reported and concluded that there is no problem undertone associated with it. The government may continue to sanction the payment dependent. Now, that was the background.”</p><p>The Justice Minister said the FG took further steps to demand for indemnity from the governors.</p><p>That way, he said, it would be certain that the payments are made with the NGF’s consent in writing.</p><p>He added that the new leadership of the NGF instituted an action despite the FG acting on the Supreme Court’s judgment.</p><p>Malami added, “They now embarked on a fresh legal suit, challenging the payment, the previous agreement, the indemnity and the Federal High Court dismissed their case.’’</p><p>But a top NGF official said the governors would not respond to Malami officially because the case was in court and therefore, sub judice.</p><p>According to him, since the President had directed that the payment should be stopped until the case is decided by the court, the AGF should allow the court to decide the matter.</p><p>The source said, “I don’t know what he (Malami) wants to do. But Buhari has authorised that no payment should be made. So, can he now go and continue to effect payment? He has tried every means.</p><p>“He is trying to get this matter through another way. It did not go. The courts are still on it. There is an appeal. One of the consultants even went ahead and did his own case.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5BrZqaZnJa6qnnNoJ1mp55isLC4y6KqoqeeYrCwwdGsnGanppq%2FboCQcaRmnJWZwqTAyKilrGc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmalami-ngf-on-collision-course-over-418m-deductions.html&text=Malami%2c%20NGF%20On%20Collision%20Course%20Over%20%24418m%20Deductions&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmalami-ngf-on-collision-course-over-418m-deductions.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmalami-ngf-on-collision-course-over-418m-deductions.html&title=Malami%2c%20NGF%20On%20Collision%20Course%20Over%20%24418m%20Deductions" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmalami-ngf-on-collision-course-over-418m-deductions.html&title=Malami%2c%20NGF%20On%20Collision%20Course%20Over%20%24418m%20Deductions" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmalami-ngf-on-collision-course-over-418m-deductions.html&title=Malami%2c%20NGF%20On%20Collision%20Course%20Over%20%24418m%20Deductions" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmalami-ngf-on-collision-course-over-418m-deductions.html&description=Malami%2c%20NGF%20On%20Collision%20Course%20Over%20%24418m%20Deductions" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./robert-duvall-related-to-shelley-duvall.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Were Robert Duvall and Shelley Duvall Related?
