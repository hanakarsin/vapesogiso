The most significant change was seeing the family together without the person they called in their premiere, their "glue," <a href=#>Traci Braxton</a>.</p><p>Traci's personality was impossible to miss during her time on <a href=#>Braxton Family Values</a>. Sadly, her loved ones and fans only have the memories of her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">quotable moments</a>, as she died of esophageal cancer at 50 in March 2022.</p><p>When Traci passed away, she left behind her extended and immediate family, which included her husband, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin Surratt, Sr.</a>, and their son, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin, Jr.</a> Since Traci's death, both Kevins have had personal issues, some of which were discussed during The Braxtons premiere.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@tracibraxton</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who was Traci Braxton's husband, Kevin Surratt, Sr.?</h2><p>While Braxton Family Values showed the Braxton sisters dealing with<strong> </strong><a href=#>divorces</a> and<strong> </strong><a href=#>breakups</a><strong>, </strong>Traci and Kevin Sr. were the series' flagship couple. The pair were married on Aug. 31, 1996, and were together for 25 years before Traci died. Like his wife, Kevin Sr. worked behind the scenes and is known for his work as a producer on a morning talk show called Great Day Washington.</p><p>Kevin Sr. and Traci were open about their marriage's ups and downs. In addition to discussing their relationship on the show, they appeared on Marriage Boot Camp: Celebrity Edition in 2014. They resolved their issues after the show and were seemingly on good terms before she died. However, Kevin's relationship with Traci's family shifted following Traci's death. In March 2022, an insider for the sisters expressed their frustrations with Kevin to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kevin Sr L Surratt (@sirratt65)</a></p></figure><p>The insider claimed that Traci's husband and her manager orchestrated a funeral with a viewing and Zoom links against Traci's wishes. They insisted Traci "did not want a funeral or wake" and "specifically requested to be immediately cremated" upon her death. Kevin went ahead with the funeral, though none of Traci's sisters nor her mother showed up. Her father, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Braxton, Sr.</a>, attended the funeral but was reportedly initially denied access for "not being on the list.”</p><p>Kevin stated refuted the insider's claims by telling Page Six the sisters and Evelyn were invited, but decided not to come. He said Traci's father and brother, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Jr.</a>, "briefly" came to the funeral and weren't pushed away from celebrating Traci's life. Kevin also slammed the sisters for making him out to be a "deadbeat husband" in the media and claimed Traci "wanted a viewing and one memorial service in conjunction with her management, PR, and other members to come together and celebrate her.”</p><p>"I was with my wife… more than anybody in this world," Kevin Sr. said. "I know my wife, and when she got cancer, we really started to communicate about funeral plans and I was still trying to find treatments for her. I went to every single one of her doctor appointments throughout our entire marriage. That’s how we were, and now they’re treating me like a [deadbeat] husband.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by SirKevjr 🔙🔛🔝 (@sirkevinjr)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">'The Braxtons' revealed Traci Braxton's son and her husband are estranged.</h2><p>Traci and Kevin, Sr. had one child during their marriage, their son, Kevin Surratt, Jr. On BFV, fans often saw Traci and Kevin Jr.'s tight bond. Unfortunately, according to Trina Braxton, Kevin Sr. and Kevin Jr.'s relationship worsened after losing their family's matriarch.</p><p>In a scene from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Braxtons premiere</a>, Trina briefly spoke to her husband, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Von Scales</a>, about the status of "Big Kev" and "Little Kev's" relationship.

"It doesn't matter my personal feelings towards him, he's still a grieving husband. But when your surviving parent is shut down, and the parent you talk to is gone, who do you have? It's almost a loss of both parents."</p><p>From what we see of Kevin Sr. and Kevin Jr.'s social media handles, they seem to be trying to build a relationship. However, the premiere also showed that Kevin Jr. is facing some turmoil in his personal life. In the season premiere, he shared that he's getting a divorce from his wife, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Olivia Haaron</a>, after three years of marriage. Kevin and Olivia were together for 10 years and have two children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqb%2Bir8hmmauZqKm8r3nHrqqbmZ6Z</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftraci-braxton-husband.html&text=Who%20Was%20Traci%20Braxton%27s%20Husband%3f%20Details%20on%20Her%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftraci-braxton-husband.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftraci-braxton-husband.html&title=Who%20Was%20Traci%20Braxton%27s%20Husband%3f%20Details%20on%20Her%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftraci-braxton-husband.html&title=Who%20Was%20Traci%20Braxton%27s%20Husband%3f%20Details%20on%20Her%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftraci-braxton-husband.html&title=Who%20Was%20Traci%20Braxton%27s%20Husband%3f%20Details%20on%20Her%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftraci-braxton-husband.html&description=Who%20Was%20Traci%20Braxton%27s%20Husband%3f%20Details%20on%20Her%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=next><a href=./pretty-little-liars-original-sin-release-date.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="When Is the 'Pretty Little Liars: Original Sin' Release Date?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
