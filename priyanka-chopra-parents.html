I was like, of course, it’s your parents’ job to do that. My career matters. And I didn’t even think about it until I was writing my book," she shared. "And then it dawned on me like now I’m in my 40s.

And we are so blessed to have parents who did that. But, there are families under societal pressures that don’t necessarily know that they can let their daughters have aspirations," Priyanka told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Femina</a>. "So, I think that the one thing that we need to do is create a dialogue around parenting, around raising our sons in a way in which there is respect for women, creating opportunities in society where women are in positions of power. Not just getting jobs, but actually being decision-makers. I think that’s what’s going to change it for us."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span><p>Priyanka Chopra with her mom, Madhu, and her daughter, Malti.</p></figure><p style=text-align:start>This is not the first time the Love Again actress is speaking up in admiration about the example that her parents set for her.
