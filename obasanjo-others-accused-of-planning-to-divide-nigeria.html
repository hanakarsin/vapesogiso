Solomon Semanka</strong>, on Thursday.</p><p>The group alleged that Obasanjo’s recent comments are plans to discredit the achievements recorded by President Muhammadu Buhari administration.</p><p>According to the group, <strong><a href=#>Obasanjo</a></strong> is trying to rubbish the Buhari government having surpassed his administration both as military and civilian head of state.</p><p>The movement, however, warned the former leader and his alleged co-conspirators to thread with caution and rethink his intentions.</p><p>The statement read: “The attention of the Save Nigeria Movement has been drawn to media reports indicating former president Olusegun Obasanjo’s decision to embark on another round of divisive consultations conversant with his character. Media reports further indicate Obasanjo plans to co-opt past heads of state, traditional rulers , religious leaders and some respected elder statesmen among which is a former federal commissioner Pa Edwin Clark into the massive drive to divide the country. All these antics are in a bid to discredit president Buhari administration efforts having surpassed former president Obasanjo’s two epochs in office both as military and civilian head of state.</p><p>“Former President Olusegun Obasanjo’s antecedents are scary if allowed to fester. The Save Nigeria Movement is deeply concerned that Obasanjo would choose to inflame passions and raise tensions at this critical point in time when the federal government is consolidating on security. Former President Olusegun is urged to reconsider his personal agenda as it can only jeopardise national security. To this end, the Movement is suspicious of the former president and calls all Nigerians to speak in one voice against him.</p><p>“The Save Nigeria Movement is inclined to caution the former president to have a rethink if his personal intentions will not promote peace and unity in the country. This appeal is also a word of caution that should Obasanjo be bent on heating the polity and raising tensions, Nigerians will know who to hold responsible and demand for the law to take its full course.</p><p>“As citizens and true patriots, we expect nothing but selfless service to the nation and moral support from people like former President Olusegun Obasanjo and not the other way round shamelessly fanning the embers of disunity. Former President Olusegun Obasanjo is urged to once again remind himself of the pledges he made at each moment this country gave him the opportunity to serve the nation. We believe good conscience will prevail for the right thing to be done.”</p><p>The group said Obasanjo has no right to be dissatisfied with the achievements of the Buhari -led administration, having served the country twice.</p><p>It added: “Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has no moral right to be dissatisfied with the modest achievements of president Buhari administration especially when he could not do better when Nigerians gave him the opportunity twice as military and civilian head of state.</p><p>“Indeed, President Buhari has offended many people in the mould of Obasanjo by not joining the league of those who must own a presidential library, an oil well or a multinational farm while in office. Looks like former president Obasanjo truly missed the infamous “third term” where he would have consolidated his full grip on the nation’s resources. This is the point of departure between Former President Obasanjo, his cohorts and incumbent President Buhari.</p><p>“Former President Obasanjo is further called upon to help the Yoruba nation heal by providing immediate and satisfactory answers to the gruesome murder of late sage chief Bola Ige; one of Yoruba’s most admired sons. Perhaps, that is what all Yoruba nation and indeed Nigerians want at this moment. How about the gruesome political assassination of Harry Marshal and many others? Former President Olusegun Obasanjo should be magnanimous enough to come clear on these unresolved puzzles around political killings and corrupt enrichment while in office as president than resort to self pontification.</p><p>“We will not talk about the infamous kidnap of a sitting governor in the South East under the inglorious watch of the seasoned Otta farmer. Nigerians do not want those memories. Obasanjo should seize the moment to re-write history with his words and public conduct.</p><p>“At least under President Buhari administration, no such high profile killings are in vogue. No such fanfare over the launching of presidential libraries or other business concerns of the sort is ongoing unlike under former president Olusegun Obasanjo’s regime. Should we begin to review how Obasanjo muzzled Lagos State, the economic nerve center, the heart of Yoruba nation of statutory funds in flagrant disregard for court orders? Which true Yoruba Son worthy of his name would be proud of Obasanjo? Nigerians have had enough of whatever salvage value is left of Mr Obasanjo.”</p><p>The group stated that Nigerians are happy with the Buhari government over its fights against corruption and insurgency.</p><p>It said: “Nigerians are proud of what President Buhari is doing to rescue the nation from the grip of people like Obasanjo who designated the country as a free zone for corruption for more than a decade. Nigerians from all walks of life are proud of the modest achievements recorded under the Buhari administration. From road infrastructure to massive social welfare packages and a historic recapture of territories hitherto held by insurgents and bandits.”</p><p>“At least president Buhari has not mobilized soldiers to demolish communities and kill scores of innocent Nigerians like Obasanjo did in Odi, Bayelsa and Zakibiam, in Benue states respectively during Obasanjo’s reign as president.”</p><p>“Nigerians are indeed asking when former president Obasanjo would be called upon to account for his many sins against his Yoruba kinsmen and Nigerians. This may truly be the moment of judgement. President Buhari administration in all sincerity has admitted to challenges and taken steps to secure the nation, all the government needs now is wise counsel and moral support as opposed to acts that could jeorpardise existing efforts in peace and security of the country.”</p><p>“Let us rise up and hold our leaders to standards that will ensure the legacies of peace and unity. This is our responsibility. It is in fulfilling this obligation that the Save Nigeria Movement is calling on former president Olusegun Obasanjo to respect himself and status and desist from acts capable of reversing the progress so far made in country. The whole world is watching and will join us in solidarity to hold anyone who would be responsible for acts that breach national security.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ze5BwZqiakaiur7bOZqatoJWnwG6twpysrJ2UYrynec%2BlmKemmaO0bsDOZpuirpmZsm66yKCcq6GRZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fobasanjo-others-accused-of-planning-to-divide-nigeria.html&text=Obasanjo%2c%20Others%20Accused%20Of%20Planning%20To%20Divide%20Nigeria&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fobasanjo-others-accused-of-planning-to-divide-nigeria.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fobasanjo-others-accused-of-planning-to-divide-nigeria.html&title=Obasanjo%2c%20Others%20Accused%20Of%20Planning%20To%20Divide%20Nigeria" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fobasanjo-others-accused-of-planning-to-divide-nigeria.html&title=Obasanjo%2c%20Others%20Accused%20Of%20Planning%20To%20Divide%20Nigeria" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fobasanjo-others-accused-of-planning-to-divide-nigeria.html&title=Obasanjo%2c%20Others%20Accused%20Of%20Planning%20To%20Divide%20Nigeria" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fobasanjo-others-accused-of-planning-to-divide-nigeria.html&description=Obasanjo%2c%20Others%20Accused%20Of%20Planning%20To%20Divide%20Nigeria" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./september15-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="September 15 Birthdays | Famous Birthdays">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./liberian-president-rewards-nigerian-army-for-a-job-well-done.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Liberian President Rewards Nigerian Army For A Job Well Done">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
