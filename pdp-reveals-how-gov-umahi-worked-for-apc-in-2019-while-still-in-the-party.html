CID Maduabum</strong>, said Umahi sabotaged party efforts and worked against the PDP during the 2019 elections despite being a party member at that time.</p><p>The allegation comes as part of the response to the position of the Ebonyi State Governor who on Friday said southern governors and particularly <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>those of them from the PDP</a></strong> are not trustworthy.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> recalls he made the submission during a TV interview where he also ruled out the possibility of the 2023 presidential ticket getting zoned to the southern region of the country by the PDP.</p><p>He said the body language of his colleagues showed that the PDP has no intention of zoning its presidential ticket to the south neither do the governors themselves have any intention of backing up their words demanding a southern presidency with action.</p><p>However, the governors on Saturday gave him a response and also called him out as a traitor.</p><p>In a statement by Maduabum titled ‘Umahi should face APC misrule and his frustrations,’ the PDP governors accused Umahi of deception and manipulation, adding that the Ebonyi Governor’s eventual exit from the party was good riddance.</p><p>The statement reads in part, “The PDP Governors Forum is outraged at the attempt by the Governor of Ebonyi State, David Umahi, who illegally and immoraly [sic] sits on a PDP mandate and calls himself an APC Governor, to turn truth on its head.</p><p>“Umahi left PDP for APC, according to him, because of the love he has for President Buhari, among other flimsy reasons, irrespective of the maladministration and daily incidents of destruction of lives and properties currently going on in Ebonyi State and the entire country under the watch of APC.</p><p>“Umahi sabotaged the PDP in 2019 elections in his quest to deliver 25 percent to his APC benefactors. It took the determined resistance of Ebonyi people to checkmate him. It was good riddance that he subsequently left PDP for APC instead of continuing his role as an APC mole.“</p><p>On the issue of zoning, the PDP-GF said the opposition party doesn’t need any recommendation from the APC, saying the ruling party has disappointed Nigerians and should focus on its woes.</p><p>It added that the party’s position on the zoning of its 2023 presidential ticket will be made public at the right time.</p><p>&nbsp;“We advise Umahi to face his frustrations in APC and not drag PDP and her governors into it.</p><p>“PDP is an independent political party with workable structures and method of doing things. It’s not an appendage of the APC or, indeed, any other association or group.</p><p>“The PDP will take its decision on the issue of zoning political offices at the appropriate time. Even the APC has not taken any decision yet on zoning.</p><p>“Different groups and interests are advancing arguments to defend their positions as is required in a democracy. At the end of the day, decisions will be taken by each political party.</p><p>“The PDP is single minded in its resolve to boot out the APC in 2023 and would craft strategies to achieve same in the national interest as APC currently represents an existential threat to Nigeria’s democracy and survival. Indeed all Nigerians have a duty and responsibility to end this long nightmare of APC misrule,“ the PDP-GF said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5BxZqmcoGK%2FpsLEmqOsZZikxG6zzq9krqWRnbZuw86rop6cXZu8s3nAqZpmoZ5if3F9mGauoaGcmnq0wMilo2ahnmLBqbGMqZirrKlk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fpdp-reveals-how-gov-umahi-worked-for-apc-in-2019-while-still-in-the-party.html&text=PDP%20Reveals%20How%20Gov%20Umahi%20Worked%20For%20APC%20In%202019%20While%20Still%20In%20The%20Party&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpdp-reveals-how-gov-umahi-worked-for-apc-in-2019-while-still-in-the-party.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpdp-reveals-how-gov-umahi-worked-for-apc-in-2019-while-still-in-the-party.html&title=PDP%20Reveals%20How%20Gov%20Umahi%20Worked%20For%20APC%20In%202019%20While%20Still%20In%20The%20Party" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fpdp-reveals-how-gov-umahi-worked-for-apc-in-2019-while-still-in-the-party.html&title=PDP%20Reveals%20How%20Gov%20Umahi%20Worked%20For%20APC%20In%202019%20While%20Still%20In%20The%20Party" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fpdp-reveals-how-gov-umahi-worked-for-apc-in-2019-while-still-in-the-party.html&title=PDP%20Reveals%20How%20Gov%20Umahi%20Worked%20For%20APC%20In%202019%20While%20Still%20In%20The%20Party" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpdp-reveals-how-gov-umahi-worked-for-apc-in-2019-while-still-in-the-party.html&description=PDP%20Reveals%20How%20Gov%20Umahi%20Worked%20For%20APC%20In%202019%20While%20Still%20In%20The%20Party" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./411679-2-police-officers-who-shot-dead-woman-city-park-found-guilty-manslaughter-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="2 Police Officers Who Shot Dead Woman at City Park Found Guilty of Manslaughter">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./nigeria-may-go-from-crisis-to-crisis-if-sam-adeyemi.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nigeria May Go From Crisis To Crisis If...">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
