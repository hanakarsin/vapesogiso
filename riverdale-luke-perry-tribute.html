"Luke's manager Steve (Himber) was very supportive, and I went into it knowing that I was being supported by everyone that really mattered to Luke. And knowing that it was a show that he had been trying to get me on since day one, it was like this really beautiful moment."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The ‘Riverdale’ cast and crew shared touching social media posts in the lead-up to the Luke Perry tribute.</h2><p>Lili Reinhart, who plays Betty Cooper on the show, said in a tweet that Luke's tribute is “the most important episode we’ve ever filmed.”&nbsp;</p><p>Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, the show’s creator, tweeted that the Season 4 premiere is &nbsp;“an episode that’s bursting with sadness, but even more so with love,” adding, “I hope you like it, Luke.

In a recent Q&A, Roberto shared that Luke’s death made filming the show difficult for everyone, especially KJ. “Almost every episode, [KJ and Luke] had a scene in the kitchen and no matter what was going on, you’d find them at the island and Fred would be giving Archie advice which he would or wouldn’t listen to," Roberto explained.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: The CW</span></figure><p>&nbsp;"That was a real touchstone for KJ, I think," he continued. "So I talked to KJ about it. I think everyone was really proud to gather, to tell this tribute to Fred and to Luke. […] When it happened, we were all scattered, so there was something really special when we all gathered to do the table read that was cathartic. But we knew it was going to be hard, and it was.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Where can you watch the season 4 premiere of ‘Riverdale’?</h2><p>“Chapter Fifty-Eight In Memoriam” will air on The CW on Wednesday, Oct. 9, at 8 EST.&nbsp;</p><p>If you miss it tonight, don’t worry! it’ll be streaming on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The CW</u></a> site starting tomorrow — you can also catch up on anything you may have missed there (including the <a href=#><u>bloody Season 3 finale</u></a>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp7a3sdGdmKWdXaHCrLGMqZyrqqliwbO1wa6rng%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2friverdale-luke-perry-tribute.html&text=This%20Is%20How%20%27Riverdale%27%20Paid%20Tribute%20to%20Luke%20Perry&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2friverdale-luke-perry-tribute.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2friverdale-luke-perry-tribute.html&title=This%20Is%20How%20%27Riverdale%27%20Paid%20Tribute%20to%20Luke%20Perry" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2friverdale-luke-perry-tribute.html&title=This%20Is%20How%20%27Riverdale%27%20Paid%20Tribute%20to%20Luke%20Perry" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2friverdale-luke-perry-tribute.html&title=This%20Is%20How%20%27Riverdale%27%20Paid%20Tribute%20to%20Luke%20Perry" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2friverdale-luke-perry-tribute.html&description=This%20Is%20How%20%27Riverdale%27%20Paid%20Tribute%20to%20Luke%20Perry" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mugen-train-arc-vs-movie.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Mugen Train' Arc vs. Movie: Which Is Better?
