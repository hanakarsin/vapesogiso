The severity of that new haircut led many to wonder why Dom had decided to shave his head.</p><p>While it could have been a simple aesthetic choice, Dom's reason for shaving his head runs a lot deeper than that.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Dom Tiberi shave his head?</h2><p>Dom and the rest of his family, including his two kids, all decided to shave their heads in solidarity with Dom's wife Terri, who is currently undergoing treatment for breast cancer. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In a tweet</a>, Dom explained his decision to save his head, and added that it was originally his daughter's idea, one that the rest of the family evidently bought into.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Nobody fights cancer alone. My beautiful wife Terri is battling breast cancer," Dom wrote on Twitter, accompanied by a photo of the entire family rocking their new, hairless look. "She is getting incredible treatment at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@OSUCCC_James</a> and Spielman Center. My daughter Kelsey thought we all should shave our heads to show our love and support for Terri. She is as tough as they come!"</p><p>In a segment aired on WBNS, Dom got a chance to further elaborate on why he had decided to shave his head. "Our hair will grow back," Dom explained during the segment. "We just wanted Terri to know how important she is to us, and how much we love her. Terri's the toughest person I know, and I'm lucky to have her. She's already been through a whole bunch in this thing we call life, and it's not fair, but she will beat this, and we will be there with her."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dom is receiving plenty of support from his many fans.</h2><p>Following Dom's decision to shave his head, he received plenty of support from online fans who wished both him and Terri well.</p><p>"Dom, my prayers are with you and your incredibly strong family. You're right, nobody fights alone, and you all have quite the army of support behind you. I will be a soldier in that army! Please give Terri my best," one person wrote in response to his tweet.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Sending you and your family love. Praying for the best possible outcome for your wife. God bless you all!" another person wrote.</p><p>"You got this, Terri! Always loved when we'd cross paths on bowl trips or wherever it may be," another person added.</p><p>Dom and Terri are clearly valued not just because of Dom's role on the network, but also because of their deep ties to the community where they're from.</p><p>Dom's decision to shave his head is just one small gesture that speaks to his dedication to his wife. As Dom knows well, the hair will grow back, but the solidarity likely means a lot. Dom shaved his head for a great reason, and the support he's received shows that the entire community is with him and Terri.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2acn6J6tbXBnqmiZaOdrrexjKGgrGWYmq6l</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-did-dom-tiberi-shave-his-head.html&text=Why%20Did%20Dom%20Tiberi%20Shave%20His%20Head%3f%20It%27s%20an%20Act%20of%20Solidarity&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-did-dom-tiberi-shave-his-head.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-dom-tiberi-shave-his-head.html&title=Why%20Did%20Dom%20Tiberi%20Shave%20His%20Head%3f%20It%27s%20an%20Act%20of%20Solidarity" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-did-dom-tiberi-shave-his-head.html&title=Why%20Did%20Dom%20Tiberi%20Shave%20His%20Head%3f%20It%27s%20an%20Act%20of%20Solidarity" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-dom-tiberi-shave-his-head.html&title=Why%20Did%20Dom%20Tiberi%20Shave%20His%20Head%3f%20It%27s%20an%20Act%20of%20Solidarity" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-did-dom-tiberi-shave-his-head.html&description=Why%20Did%20Dom%20Tiberi%20Shave%20His%20Head%3f%20It%27s%20an%20Act%20of%20Solidarity" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-last-of-us-game-plot.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'The Last of Us' Is Finally out on HBO!
