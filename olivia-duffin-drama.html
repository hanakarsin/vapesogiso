Olivia Duffin's uncanny resemblance to Ariana Grande (who has a huge fanbase herself) got her millions of followers, and just a few enemies.</p><p>Earlier in December, Olivia's ex-boyfriend, Liam Casey,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> leaked text messages between the pair on Twitter</a> (warning that the messages might be triggering because of their sensitive nature).</p><p>In them, he discussed how he identified as bisexual, and Olivia responded with some hateful messages. She was then under fire, as many people accused her of being anti-bi and for spreading hate.</p><p>The messages picked up traction when&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ImAllexx on YouTube</a>) posted a video breaking down the texts one by one. The texts included Olivia saying that she doesn't believe bisexuality is real.</p><p>"I don't agree with bi," she texted her ex. "You're either gay or you're not, Liam."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>"It's a thing, whether you agree with it or not," Liam &nbsp;wrote back.</p><p>"Yeah, well I don't," was Olivia's apparent response.&nbsp;</p><p>She echoed her words multiple other times in the text screenshots grabbed from ImAllexx.&nbsp;</p><p>She also allegedly stated in the texts that the concept of consent doesn't exist in relationships.</p><p>Many fans then began to criticize Olivia's contradictory sentiments, and how she shamed her ex for his sexuality. In another video, the man behind ImAllexx stated that Olivia blocked him after posting that video.&nbsp;</p><p>It is important to note that Liam has expressed his support for ImAllexx's video about the texting incident with Olivia.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I know I said I wouldnâ€™t talk about the whole situation, but Alex has really helped me get over any negative feelings Iâ€™ve been stuck with from it. I love this guyðŸ’™ <a href=#>https://t.co/4QnP2XaLwt</a></p>â€” Liam Casey (@lplcasey) <a href=#>December 17, 2019</a></figure><p>She later took to her channel to express how she's not a bigot, but her response drew even more criticism.&nbsp;</p><p>"I loved my ex-boyfriend so much. I spent 2 and a half years with him. And experiencing all of those memories with someone, and being with them for 2 and a half years, of course it's going to hurt me if he comes out and tells me he's not straight," she began in her TikTok.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"Bisexuality is 100% okay, I'm all for it," she continued. "I have a lot of gay and bi friends, and I have nothing against them. I love them all, they're so amazing."</p><p>She also discussed what she meant by the idea that consent doesn't exist in relationships.</p><p>"And the consent thing, I didn't mean it in that way... he called me a rapist for no reason. He asked me to do something on holiday for him, and I did," she said. "And apparently, that's rape. Consent does matter in a relationship."</p><p>She went on to say that she got a lot of threats and hate from people who had seen the texts.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>In a strange move, Olivia's next lip-syncing TikTok also appeared to address the controversy. She captioned the video "sexuality doesn't matter" and kissed a girl in the lip sync video. &nbsp;</p><p>Liam also tweeted his thoughts on the text messages becoming public and he thanked ImAllexx for "sticking up" for him. He also called out Sofi Winters â€” but what's her involvement in the matter?</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>@ImAllexx</a> <a href=#>@itsoliviaduffin</a> <a href=#>@SofiWinters</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/UsGrRVzIFs</a></p>â€” Liam Casey (@lplcasey) <a href=#>December 10, 2019</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Olivia Duffin's beef with Sofi Winters explained.</h2><p>Though Olivia is certainly making a lot of enemies now that her texts with Liam are public, she also has been having issues with Sofi Winters, who has nearly 400,000 followers on TikTok and over 8 million likes.</p><p>According to Sofi's side of the story (which she posted about in a video on her channel), she reached out to Olivia before she really got famous on TikTok.</p><p>Sofi said that her followers had been requesting for her to do a duet with Olivia, and she messaged Olivia online. She claims Olivia was eager to fly to meet with Sofi so they could sing together, but she soon began ghosting Sofi.</p><p>Then, several months later (after she got more famous), Olivia went live and talked about how she never answered Sofi because she was uninterested in singing with her.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"I'm not being nasty, but, I'm doing really well on my own. And you're not," Olivia said about Sofi when she went live.&nbsp;</p><p>"Yeah, pretty disgusting and shocking, I know," Sofi responded.</p><p>She went on to post the screenshots of their exchange, which showed how Olivia was interested in singing with Sofi at first.</p><p>The two have yet to resolve their issues, as evidenced by the fact that Sofi's TikTok bio is, "For all asking, yes Iâ€™m the girl who was bashed by Olivia."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpLmqwsiaZJ2tlpu2r3nDq5immQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2folivia-duffin-drama.html&text=Olivia%20Duffin%27s%20Drama%20on%20TikTok%20Is%20Wild%20%20Find%20Out%20What%20Happened&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2folivia-duffin-drama.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2folivia-duffin-drama.html&title=Olivia%20Duffin%27s%20Drama%20on%20TikTok%20Is%20Wild%20%20Find%20Out%20What%20Happened" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2folivia-duffin-drama.html&title=Olivia%20Duffin%27s%20Drama%20on%20TikTok%20Is%20Wild%20%20Find%20Out%20What%20Happened" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2folivia-duffin-drama.html&title=Olivia%20Duffin%27s%20Drama%20on%20TikTok%20Is%20Wild%20%20Find%20Out%20What%20Happened" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2folivia-duffin-drama.html&description=Olivia%20Duffin%27s%20Drama%20on%20TikTok%20Is%20Wild%20%20Find%20Out%20What%20Happened" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./just-in-pdp-reacts-as-matawalle-defects-to-apc.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="PDP Reacts As Matawalle Defects To APC">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./412299-nelson-havi-asema-hawezi-kumwakilisha-raila-kortini-kutetea-bbi-kwa-jinsi-ilivyo-haikubaliki-kikatiba-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nelson Havi Asema Hawezi Kumwakilisha Raila Kortini Kutetea BBI kwa Jinsi Ilivyo Haikubaliki Kikatib">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
