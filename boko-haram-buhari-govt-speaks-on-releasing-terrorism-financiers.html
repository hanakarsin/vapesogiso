The contradictions in the story can best be understood from the point of the analysis of the affidavit that was said to have been procured by as deposed to before a court in relation the subject matter.</p><p>“By their own showing, the Office of the Attorney General, has deposed to an affidavit on account of which an order of a court was obtained, seeking for the continued detention of those financiers that were alleged to have been in custody.</p><p>“This, by implication, established that the matter is effectively submitted to the jurisdiction of the court.</p><p>“It is common knowledge that where a matter is submitted to a court of law, it is only through the judicial process that any subsequent action can possibly be taken.</p><p>“The question then arising from the claim is this: When was an application filed in court by the office of the Attorney General by which the release of the purported suspects was procured?</p><p>“It amounts to approbation and reprobation for the office of the Attorney General of the Federation to, in one breath, obtain an order seeking for continued detention of the alleged financiers of Boko Haram and at the same time having them released.</p><p>“The most important and in fact, interesting aspect that people would like to know about the mischief associated with the position of the story was who are the custodian of these people alleged to have been taken into custody.</p><p>“One needs to know by which communication or correspondence or application was their release procured since the matter is already pending before the court of law, and they were taken to custody on account of court order.</p><p>“It does not add up for the office of the Attorney General of the Federation to procure the release of someone that has been in custody on account of court order without approaching the court.</p><p>“The public, in essence, are entitled to know which application was it that was subsequently filed to procure the release of the financiers.</p><p>“When was the application filed, before which court was it taken and which lawyer is it that has taken the application and where is the court order on which account the release was effected?</p><p>“We are also amazed that an allegation of bribe taking is made. The public is entitled to know who the originator of the bribery was and who facilitated the giving of the&nbsp; bribe?</p><p>“Who accepted or collected the bribe on behalf of the Attorney General? Who were the vendors and facilitators?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5FuZpunm6R6qa3RmqRmmqWdrrO1jKCmr6xdqL2mrcqsZKimXaeyrbHArKCnn12psrO%2BzqugrKVdm7avrc2coJ6qo2Q%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fboko-haram-buhari-govt-speaks-on-releasing-terrorism-financiers.html&text=Buhari%20Govt%20Speaks%20On%20Releasing%20Terrorism%20Financiers&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fboko-haram-buhari-govt-speaks-on-releasing-terrorism-financiers.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fboko-haram-buhari-govt-speaks-on-releasing-terrorism-financiers.html&title=Buhari%20Govt%20Speaks%20On%20Releasing%20Terrorism%20Financiers" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fboko-haram-buhari-govt-speaks-on-releasing-terrorism-financiers.html&title=Buhari%20Govt%20Speaks%20On%20Releasing%20Terrorism%20Financiers" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fboko-haram-buhari-govt-speaks-on-releasing-terrorism-financiers.html&title=Buhari%20Govt%20Speaks%20On%20Releasing%20Terrorism%20Financiers" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fboko-haram-buhari-govt-speaks-on-releasing-terrorism-financiers.html&description=Buhari%20Govt%20Speaks%20On%20Releasing%20Terrorism%20Financiers" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ebonyi-wont-collect-vat-some-states-will-die-if-vat-collection-is-taken-away-from-fg-umahi.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ebonyi Won't Collect VAT, Some States Will 'Die' If VAT Collection Is Taken Away From FG">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./armin-buuren-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Armin van Buuren - Age, Family, Bio">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
