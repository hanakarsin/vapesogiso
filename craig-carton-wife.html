Following the news, many were sad to hear that Craig was leaving the station, and some also wanted to better understand more about him when he isn't on the radio.</p><p>Part of this curiosity led them to wonder who Craig's wife is, and what his life with his family is like more broadly.

Kim had a career in the cleaning industry, and some reporting suggests that she was a successful businesswoman in her own right earlier in life. She was born in 1975 and is from Huntington, Penn. Not much additional information is available about her, other than the fact that she used to run an organization called the Tic Toc Stop Foundation, which Craig created.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What is Craig's net worth?</h2><p>Reports suggest that one of the reasons Craig has decided to leave WFAN is because of the much larger salary he's making for his on-air talent on FS1. The deal is reportedly seven figures, but it isn't clear exactly what his salary is. Regardless, Craig is certainly making a fair bit of money, which has led many to wonder what his actual net worth is. According to publicly available information, it's somewhere around $4 million.</p><p class="sc-ktvXtq dPyThM"><span>Craig Carton</span></p><p class="sc-fxFQrc gpgOkp">Sports Broadcaster</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $4 Million</p><p style=text-align:start>Craig Carton is a sports broadcaster known for his radio show on WFAN and for his in-development FS1 show.

Craig expressed his mixed feelings about that decision.</p><p>“Happy day and a very sad day for me, it’s one of the most difficult days I’ll ever do in radio, because I’m leaving WFAN,” Craig said, adding that his final day with the station would be June 30.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Does LeBron James deserve a statue with the Lakers? 🤔<a href=#>@HardawaySr</a> and <a href=#>@89JonesNTAF</a> debate: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/h8m8W8igWN</a></p>— The Carton Show (@TheCartonShow) <a href=#>June 16, 2023</a></figure><p>Craig also said that his decision to leave had nothing to do with his co-host Evan Roberts or anyone else at WFAN.</p><p>“I love Evan. It has nothing to do with Evan Roberts, nothing to do with anyone here,” he said. “It has to do with my personal life and the opportunity I have to do a show at Fox Sports and FS1. WFAN is family to me. WFAN is everything to me. I’m a 30-plus year talk show host and radio is the only thing I’ve ever done well.”</p><p>Craig explained that his prison sentence had left him with gambling debts, and a higher salary was necessary in part to pay those off.</p><p>“I woke up three years ago today in federal prison, where I was for a year based on bad decisions that I made. When I was that number I dreamt of the possibility of being able to one day start my career. That dream helped me survive prison," he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmL%2BitcZmmpqqpKS7bsPIn5xo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcraig-carton-wife.html&text=Who%20Is%20Craig%20Carton%27s%20Wife%3f%20Inside%20the%20Radio%20Host%27s%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcraig-carton-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcraig-carton-wife.html&title=Who%20Is%20Craig%20Carton%27s%20Wife%3f%20Inside%20the%20Radio%20Host%27s%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcraig-carton-wife.html&title=Who%20Is%20Craig%20Carton%27s%20Wife%3f%20Inside%20the%20Radio%20Host%27s%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcraig-carton-wife.html&title=Who%20Is%20Craig%20Carton%27s%20Wife%3f%20Inside%20the%20Radio%20Host%27s%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcraig-carton-wife.html&description=Who%20Is%20Craig%20Carton%27s%20Wife%3f%20Inside%20the%20Radio%20Host%27s%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./b2cutecupcakes-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="B2cutecupcakes - Age, Family, Bio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./wto-us-endorsement-of-okonjo-iweala-excites-nigeria-africa-buhari.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="US Endorsement Of Okonjo-Iweala Excites Nigeria, Africa Buhari">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
