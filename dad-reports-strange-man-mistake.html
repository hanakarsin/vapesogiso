There isn't a single thing you wouldn't do to protect them, and every single slight, or perceived attack becomes magnified in your mind and you can't help but take it seriously.</p><p>I've got two kids myself and I feel like I've got a bit of "dad-sense" ever since they were born. Although it's not as epic as some of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dad reflexes that are on display here</a>, I have become more vigilant and protective of my loved ones with every year. Sometimes, it gets pretty bad, like if I see a kid running in my son's general direction in the park, I feel my ears perk up and I have the sudden urge to jump in front of my child and punt whoever's coming at him. I never do, but evolution is a weird beast for sure.</p><p>An instinct I would act on, without hesitation, is unleashing the ever-loving fury of every swarthy, working-class Eastern European in my family on a pervert creeping on my children. So I totally understand why this dad got so out of sorts when his twin 7-year-old boys told him about a creepy dude who kept staring at them from a van outside of their school.</p><p>He immediately called the school to let them know about the weirdo.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>The school allayed his fears and the dad got to relax, sit back, and take comfort in the fact that he was looking out for his children's safety.</p><p>There was a slight problem, though: he forgot that he was contracted to perform some electrical repairs in the vicinity of his son's school. Being a maintenance man, he drives a maintenance van.</p><p>He then parked said maintenance van in the school's lot where he could eat his lunch in peace, enjoy some complimentary WiFi, and then wave to his sons while they travel to the cafeteria during their own lunch break.</p><p>It's a sweet gesture from a sweet man who just wanted to spend as much time with his children as possible.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: reddit</a></figure><p>You probably realized it already: the dad had no idea that he was the pervert his kids were talking about. Because he was in a work van and wearing sunglasses and a hat, his poor children had thought some creepy van-dweller was leering at them while they walked to lunch.</p><p>It's comforting to know the school made good on its promise to pursue the "pervert." But that's a comfort the dad probably felt some time after his van was surrounded by three cop cars ready to lay the smack down on a dude looking to toss some kids into the back.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: reddit</a></figure><p>Thankfully, the entire matter was resolved in a matter of 30 minutes, which probably felt like an eternity to the hapless dad at the center of the whole mess. After speaking with him and the principal, the police let him go.</p><p>He lost his lunch parking lot privileges, however, probably to avoid similar mistakes in the future. Should another creepster want to park his van there, at least the cops know it's not this dad.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: reddit</a></figure><p>As scary as the experience probably was, people couldn't help but laugh at the dad's situation.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: reddit</a></figure><p>Some people said "stupid" must run in the family, which is a harsh way of putting it, but I too found it kind of odd that his own children didn't recognize him in his work van. Maybe they just never saw his method of employee transportation?</p><p>But, as it turns out, other people encountered similar situations when they were children.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: reddit</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: reddit</a></figure><p>I remember when my dad shaved his mustache once... I was not a fan. I didn't call the cops on him, though.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfma6ledGep6iqpKh6tMDRmqWgnV2irq95zKKqrZmbmg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdad-reports-strange-man-mistake.html&text=Dad%20Messes%20up%20Big%20Time%20After%20Reporting%20a%20%26quot%3bPervert%26quot%3b%20at%20Son%27s%20School&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdad-reports-strange-man-mistake.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdad-reports-strange-man-mistake.html&title=Dad%20Messes%20up%20Big%20Time%20After%20Reporting%20a%20%26quot%3bPervert%26quot%3b%20at%20Son%27s%20School" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdad-reports-strange-man-mistake.html&title=Dad%20Messes%20up%20Big%20Time%20After%20Reporting%20a%20%26quot%3bPervert%26quot%3b%20at%20Son%27s%20School" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdad-reports-strange-man-mistake.html&title=Dad%20Messes%20up%20Big%20Time%20After%20Reporting%20a%20%26quot%3bPervert%26quot%3b%20at%20Son%27s%20School" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdad-reports-strange-man-mistake.html&description=Dad%20Messes%20up%20Big%20Time%20After%20Reporting%20a%20%26quot%3bPervert%26quot%3b%20at%20Son%27s%20School" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ondo-acting-governor-reveals-when-akeredolu-will-return-to-nigeria.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ondo Acting Governor Reveals When Akeredolu Will Return To Nigeria">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./andy-jassy-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Andy Jassy's Family Will Be in the Spotlight as He Takes Over Amazon">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
