Spoiler alert: She's tuning out her critics and basically winning at controlling her own narrative.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why was there backlash to Rachel Zegler being cast in 'Snow White'?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>When it was announced that Rachel Zegler would take on the role of the titular character in the March 2024 live-action update to the animated 1937 classic, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Refinery29</a>, some would-be viewers took issue with the fact that the star boasts Colombian and Polish heritage, and claimed the part should have been given to a "whiter" actress.</p><p>Ironically enough, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> previously reported, some fans weren't convinced that Rachel was Latina enough to embody the role of Maria in <a href=#>the West Side Story remake</a>.</p><p>Rachel's heritage is an issue she has never shied away from.</p><p>"You know, yeah, my dad is white — he's American," she previously <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">explained</a>. "His family has been in this country for many, many, many years. And the same can't be said for my other side of the family. I'm more immersed in my Colombian culture than I've ever been immersed in my American culture, so why does someone else get to tell me what I am?"</p><p>And yet, it seems that people are trying to yet again to tell the star what roles she can and cannot take. Twitter was overwhelmed with chatter over her Snow White casting — and much of the feedback was pretty bitter and, well, gross.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>the Rachel Zegler as Snow White debate is so unserious because people of similar complexion have been playing white characters for years & no one cared cause they were Italians or Spaniards.

Finally, Rachel noted about a collage of images of herself as a child dressed up in various costumes, including Snow White, "So I leave you with these photos! I hope every child knows they can be a princess no matter what."</p><p>Sadly, the hatred didn't stop with her post, with commenters continuing to question Rachel being cast in the part of a princess whose "skin is as white as snow."
