She added that she drove an "uninsured car for seven months and then suspended your license plate and mine."</p><p>"I couldn't drive either car with either license plate," Katie revealed, while Sara noted, "We know you had the same license plate for years. So RIP to AZK, whatever the numbers were, and to you."</p><p>Sara then confessed to her late mother that she "got the stomach virus so bad I missed Megan's baby shower." Katie told her mom that she had to throw the shower all on her own. I threw a baby shower not too long ago, and I'm not kidding when I say it's one of the most stressful things ever.</p><p>"I tried to do a charity walk for cancer, and I couldn't finish it. I think I broke my foot," Katie shared while wheezing with laughter. Sara then told their mom she didn't cry at her funeral because she was so pregnant. She explained, "If I cried, I would have thrown up."</p><p>In the end, the girls agreed that they will have "lots more" confessions to make to their deceased mom. Katie jokingly concluded, "We'll continue to disappoint you as time goes on."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok / @deniseytee</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">TikTok users said Sara's video put a smile on their faces.</h2><p>Sara's video has been viewed more than 17.8 million times and counting as of this writing; it also received over 32,500 comments from many fellow TikTokers who shared that this clip helped them cope with grief and loss.</p><p>"My mom died in April," one person said. "Thank you, I needed this laugh. (Note to self: file her taxes next year)."</p><p>A second TikTok user wrote, "I lost my mom over a year and a half ago, and I've been very depressed, BUT seeing this video and your perspective is so refreshing and heartwarming."</p><p>"I don't know how the algorithm knows I’m coming from my mom's funeral, but I needed this," a third user shared.</p><p style=text-align:start>Another person commented, "My mom passed on October 15th, and I hope to be able to laugh like this soon!

She is beaming in heaven."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Sara said humor has helped her and Katie cope with the loss of their mom.</h2><p>Distractify reached out to Sara for comment, and she responded, "My sisters and I were so lucky to have had the most amazing relationship with our mom — I think the humor & realness in the video is a reflection of that. She is certainly laughing along with us (and probably shaking her head). I truly think everyone's grief journey is different, but humor has helped us cope tremendously."</p><p>As for helping others cope with grief, Sara said she "can't believe the outpouring of support we've received. Losing a loved one, especially a parent can be so isolating so to know we are touching so many people & making them laugh means the world to us. Don't worry, we'll have plenty more confessions to come!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfma62s8etnKurXaeypLvRnWScp56bsrS%2FyKilrGWkpHqlscCdZKannQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdaughters-record-confessions-to-dead-mom.html&text=Daughters%20Record%20Themselves%20Confessing%20to%20Dead%20Mom&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdaughters-record-confessions-to-dead-mom.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdaughters-record-confessions-to-dead-mom.html&title=Daughters%20Record%20Themselves%20Confessing%20to%20Dead%20Mom" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdaughters-record-confessions-to-dead-mom.html&title=Daughters%20Record%20Themselves%20Confessing%20to%20Dead%20Mom" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdaughters-record-confessions-to-dead-mom.html&title=Daughters%20Record%20Themselves%20Confessing%20to%20Dead%20Mom" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdaughters-record-confessions-to-dead-mom.html&description=Daughters%20Record%20Themselves%20Confessing%20to%20Dead%20Mom" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./479381-dss-new-director-demotes-ogar-and-other-jonathan-men-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Head Of DSS Demotes Ogar And Other Jonathan's Allies">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./are-jeremy-strong-brian-cox-friends.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Are 'Succession' Stars Jeremy Strong and Brian Cox Friends?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
