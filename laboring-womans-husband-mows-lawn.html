Two occasions stick out in my mind when my <a href=#>husband seemingly had other things on his mind</a> than me about to bring his child into the world!</p><p>The first time, he stopped for <a href=#>coffee at Dunkin'</a> on the way to the hospital. OK, yes, it was the middle of the night, and I'm sure he was tired, but, um, reminder: I'm in labor, about to have a baby.</p><p>The other time, he couldn't quite pick out a <a href=#>parking spot</a> he felt good about in the hospital parking garage. Say what? He'll confirm that I leaped out of the moving car, went inside to check in, and he had to find me once he managed to select the right place to park our vehicle while I delivered our daughter!</p><p>Given my experiences, I had to laugh at this woman whose husband was literally mowing the lawn while she labored. Details ahead.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did this woman's husband think this was the right time to mow the lawn of all things?</h2><p><a href=#>TikTok</a> creator <a href=# style=text-align:left rel="noopener noreferrer">@stephielooloo</a> explained in her short video â€” because <a href=#>she's in labor</a> â€” that she has been having contractions all day and is ready to go to the hospital.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>As for her husband, um, not so much. "What is he doing?" she asks her following, laughing, and adding, "Typical man."</p><p>Then, she walks over to the window, where her husband is "just trimming the grass." Great timing!</p><p>"OK, I'll just be in here waddling around, packing my bag," she giggles, although there's a moment that we can see a flash of annoyance across her face, which is 100 percent fair enough.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@stephielooloo href=#>@stephielooloo</a><p>Women are superior and this is why! ðŸ¤ªðŸ˜­ <a title=itsbabytime href=#>#itsbabytime</a> <a title=laboranddelivery href=#>#laboranddelivery</a> <a title=babybump href=#>#babybump</a> <a title=girlmama href=#>#girlmama</a></p><a title="â™¬ original sound - Stephanie âœ¨" href=#>â™¬ original sound - Stephanie âœ¨</a></figure><p>The incident would be funny if so many moms couldn't relate to this TikToker's experience. Indeed, she and I are far from alone when it comes to our husbands finding something they just have to do while we prepare to birth literal people out of our bodies.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So many men find things to do other than take their laboring partners to the hospital.</h2><p>Many people could relate to <a href=#>this mom-to-be</a>, whose husband was "nervous mowing" according to one commenter.</p><p>One TikTok user shared how her friend's husband decided the moment her water broke would be an excellent time to walk their dog.</p><p>Another woman's husband was intent on washing the windows when she went into labor. Perhaps the funniest story was about a dad-to-be who took out a ladder and began decorating the house with Christmas lights.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@stephielooloo</a></figure><p>The creator, who later shared in the comments that this incident was actually a false alarm (she had the baby a few weeks later), was delighted to read more tales from women whose husbands and partners launched into completing a bunch of unrelated tasks while they labored, from washing their boat, to just taking an extra long time in the bathroom.</p><p>Meanwhile, someone else said their husband went upstairs and fell asleep, and yet another laboring woman had to wait for her man to get a haircut before they could go to the hospital.</p><p>The irony for me is that I make to-do lists for my husband all the time, and the lists yellow from time before he does any of the tasks. Why would a guy think that when their partner is in labor is a good time to get things accomplished?</p><p>At least all my husband did was grab a coffee and suffer an existential crisis over parking. Apparently he could have decided to have our car detailed before I gave birth!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoa6ju9GipaBlp6S6orrSZp%2Buq5KWu6V5zKiurGWclsSv</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flaboring-womans-husband-mows-lawn.html&text=Laboring%20Woman%27s%20Husband%20Mows%20the%20Lawn%20as%20She%20Has%20Contractions%20%20%26quot%3bTypical%20Man%26quot%3b%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flaboring-womans-husband-mows-lawn.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flaboring-womans-husband-mows-lawn.html&title=Laboring%20Woman%27s%20Husband%20Mows%20the%20Lawn%20as%20She%20Has%20Contractions%20%20%26quot%3bTypical%20Man%26quot%3b%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flaboring-womans-husband-mows-lawn.html&title=Laboring%20Woman%27s%20Husband%20Mows%20the%20Lawn%20as%20She%20Has%20Contractions%20%20%26quot%3bTypical%20Man%26quot%3b%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flaboring-womans-husband-mows-lawn.html&title=Laboring%20Woman%27s%20Husband%20Mows%20the%20Lawn%20as%20She%20Has%20Contractions%20%20%26quot%3bTypical%20Man%26quot%3b%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flaboring-womans-husband-mows-lawn.html&description=Laboring%20Woman%27s%20Husband%20Mows%20the%20Lawn%20as%20She%20Has%20Contractions%20%20%26quot%3bTypical%20Man%26quot%3b%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sylvester-stallone-speech-pattern.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sylvester Stallones Speech Pattern Is Infamous in Hollywood">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./dangote-visits-kano-state-meets-governor-abba-yusuf-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dangote Visits Kano State, Meets Governor Abba Yusuf (Photos)">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
