They love Doritos, but when you're doing your essential shopping trip once every two weeks, you're probably not focusing on stocking up on those salty, savory tortilla chips.</p><p>When they got down to their last chip, they couldn't decide who should eat it, so they decided that neither of them should, that they should save the chip as a shrine to their love for Doritos. They put it under that glass cake dome to display it because they are hilarious.</p><p>But Chuck couldn't take it anymore. He decided he needed that chip. So he devised a plan to get it. He would simply swap it with a replica and enjoy that very last Dorito. It was the perfect plan.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Imgur</a></figure><p>He posted the whole journey on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Imgur</a>. He explained that he "used wet toilet paper to sculpt a basic Dorito triangle." He added some glue and yellow watercolor "for color and structure."</p><p>I don't know that I've ever seen someone take a craft so seriously. He even compared the color to the real thing to make sure he was on the right track. How he did this while quarantined in the same home as his girlfriend, we'll never know.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Imgur</a></figure><p>Then, he put the chip in the toaster to "dry out" so it would hold its shape. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chuck spoke to Bored Panda</a> and told them that, at first, he only planned on spending about 10 minutes on this thing, thinking his girlfriend would think it was a funny joke.&nbsp;</p><p>But when he had that chip in the toaster, he realized that he was kind of nailing this thing, and he decided to go all in. By the time he'd finished, his little 10-minute project had turned into a 3-hour affair.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Imgur</a></figure><p>After the "chip" had dried out, he added some more glue and color and let it dry overnight, "draped over an old pen to give it the same wave form as the original." He wasn't about to ruin the bit because of a poorly shaped chip.&nbsp;</p><p>Once the chip was dried and shaped, Chuck knew that he had to add the signature red and green speckles of seasoning that are iconic to Cool Ranch Doritos. And this is where things got extremely hairy.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Imgur</a></figure><p>He knew that watercolors would run too much, so he decided to "try a suggestion from the comments" on his original post about it. Someone suggested that he use the seasoning from the actual chips.&nbsp;</p><p>So Chuck knew what he had to do. He fished the empty bag of Doritos out of the garbage to retrieve the seasoning. Gross, sure, but also shows some incredible commitment.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Imgur</a></figure><p>He tried using tweezers and scissors to place the individual specks of seasoning on the "chip," but surprise, surprise. It didn't work. "Apparently, the only surfaces that the spices will stick to are Dorito chips and your fingers," he wrote.</p><p>So he tried another tactic. He used a needle to paint tiny specks of red and green seasoning on his "chip." And folks, it kind of worked. He says this was the most "intense" part of the process because his girlfriend was on a call and he thought she could walk in at any second.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Imgur</a></figure><p>It might not look exactly like a Dorito from way up close, but if you're looking at it from across the room and under a glass dome, it would fool ya for a second!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Imgur</a></figure><p>He was actually going to wait until his girlfriend had fallen asleep to "pull off the switch," but she decided to take a bath, so he did it then. And it actually looks pretty good.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Imgur</a></figure><p>If you think Chuck wasted any time eating that last chip, you are sorely mistaken. The second it was out from under that glass dome and the replacement chip had taken its place, he ate the last real chip.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Imgur</a></figure><p>Chuck told Bored Panda that his girlfriend hasn't noticed the chip yet, but she has noticed that he cleaned the toaster oven, so that's good. He hopes that when she does eventually find out, she'll have a good sense of humor about it. And he said that next time they have to go to the store, they'll probably get another bag of Cool Ranch Doritos.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoa60wIydpquhpKQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flast-dorito.html&text=Dude%20Tries%20to%20%27Sandlot%27%20Steal%20the%20Last%20Dorito%20He%20and%20His%20Girlfriend%20Were%20Saving&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flast-dorito.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flast-dorito.html&title=Dude%20Tries%20to%20%27Sandlot%27%20Steal%20the%20Last%20Dorito%20He%20and%20His%20Girlfriend%20Were%20Saving" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flast-dorito.html&title=Dude%20Tries%20to%20%27Sandlot%27%20Steal%20the%20Last%20Dorito%20He%20and%20His%20Girlfriend%20Were%20Saving" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flast-dorito.html&title=Dude%20Tries%20to%20%27Sandlot%27%20Steal%20the%20Last%20Dorito%20He%20and%20His%20Girlfriend%20Were%20Saving" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flast-dorito.html&description=Dude%20Tries%20to%20%27Sandlot%27%20Steal%20the%20Last%20Dorito%20He%20and%20His%20Girlfriend%20Were%20Saving" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kalani-david-cause-of-death.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kalani David's Cause of Death: Pro-Surfer Dead at 24">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./andrea-garte-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Andrea Garte - Age, Family, Bio">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
