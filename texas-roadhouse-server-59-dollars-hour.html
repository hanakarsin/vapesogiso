People who work in the service industry, and I am including manual labor here, have nothing but respect for each other. The judgment always comes from an individual who sits comfortably in a temperature controlled office all day.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Everyone has difficult moments at their jobs, but servers also have to bear the brunt of bad customers and possibly worse coworkers or managers. It's no secret that restaurants can and tend to be extremely toxic places to work. And let's not forget how little servers usually make, in an industry where people are expected to survive on the kindness of strangers in the <a href=#>form of tips</a>. Speaking of tips, one Texas Roadhouse server shared how much she makes per hour and people lost it. Let's paycheck it out!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">This Texas Roadhouse server is making bank.</h2><p>People are unwell. When Amanda, who goes by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@amanda4xx</a> on <a href=#>TikTok</a>, revealed what her hourly pay was after tips and base, commenters decided they should start tipping servers less. I'll get to that in a minute.</p><p>First, let's take a look at where Amanda works. She's a server at a Texas Roadhouse chain restaurant in New York. The prices are pretty standard compared to other chains like Applebee's or TGI Fridays. You can get a steak meal for about $22.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>This is a slow day for Amanda who only worked a three hour shift. While we don't know when her shift started, we do know based on the receipts that she worked Friday, Aug. 4, 2023, at around 6:00 p.m. Regardless of how long she was there, this is a dinner shift on a weekend so it's bound to be good.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Here's what she made, and I'm rounding to the closest dollar.</p><ul><li>$12 on a $48 check</li><li>$20 on a $101 check</li><li>$9 on a $46 check</li><li>$30 on a $130 check</li><li>$7 on a $49 check</li><li>$22 on a $113 check</li><li>$32 on a $127 check</li><li>$12 on a $62 check</li><li>$25 on a $74 check</li></ul><p>"The majority of my tables tipped on their credit card," explained Amanda. "The restaurant owes me $95.14." Including her hourly pay which is $9.00, Amanda made $150.14 which comes out to $59.00 per hour.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">People in the comments showed up with some truly bad takes.</h2><p>"I need to lower my tips. Thanks for sharing," wrote @surfingbird_88. It's giving, why should we forgive student loan debt when I paid off my student loan? Instead of folks being happy for someone making good money in a time when earning a livable wage is tough, people were irrationally angry.</p><p>One man justified his rage by pointing out how long Amanda worked. I'm struggling to find the connection between not tipping and a shift length, but this fella doesn't like it. "She made what most people make in a full day of work from just 3 hours of taking food to tables and not making any of the food," he said. Sir, no one is stopping you from doing the same.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>A few people said they would rather tip the cooks. So it's not the act of tipping itself, it's the work involved. Once again I'm baffled by this idea that waiting tables is easy. A retired cook chimed in about how tips would be good but in doing so, explained why this doesn't make sense. "Cooks don't get tips," he wrote. "Yes, I know they make more." This guy thinks he should make more and then more.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>What isn't being discussed at all, and what I assume is happening, is the fact that Amanda probably doesn't work a 40 hour week. Her shift was three hours. She might work four or five days a week. I really think folks have forgotten that servers generally work significantly less than people with, say, an office job.</p><p>Amanda didn't let this wild vitriol get her down. In a subsequent TikTok she threatened to drop another featuring what she makes in a shift. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She did just that</a>. This time after four hours, Amanda essentially made $50.00 an hour. Looks like no one is tipping less.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbK5rdJmqaiZlJ28tr%2FEZqqeqqaav26BmGabqKSclr%2B0eceorKs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftexas-roadhouse-server-59-dollars-hour.html&text=Some%20Folks%20Think%20This%20Texas%20Roadhouse%20Server%20Makes%20Too%20Much&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftexas-roadhouse-server-59-dollars-hour.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftexas-roadhouse-server-59-dollars-hour.html&title=Some%20Folks%20Think%20This%20Texas%20Roadhouse%20Server%20Makes%20Too%20Much" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftexas-roadhouse-server-59-dollars-hour.html&title=Some%20Folks%20Think%20This%20Texas%20Roadhouse%20Server%20Makes%20Too%20Much" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftexas-roadhouse-server-59-dollars-hour.html&title=Some%20Folks%20Think%20This%20Texas%20Roadhouse%20Server%20Makes%20Too%20Much" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftexas-roadhouse-server-59-dollars-hour.html&description=Some%20Folks%20Think%20This%20Texas%20Roadhouse%20Server%20Makes%20Too%20Much" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./adamu-abdullahi-reveals-why-apc-tinubu-may-lose-2023-election.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Adamu Abdullahi Reveals Why APC, Tinubu May Lose 2023 Election">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./405132-radio-presenter-cynthia-anyango-narrates-boyfriend-vanished-pregnant-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Radio presenter Cynthia Anyango discloses her boyfriend vanished after getting her pregnant">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
