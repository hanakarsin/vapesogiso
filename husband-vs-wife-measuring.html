"You don't know what three quarters divided by two is? It's 3/8ths."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@theransonshome href=#>@theransonshome</a><p>His brain is just bumbers bouncing around like the dvd screen saver…<a title=diyhome href=#>#diyhome</a> <a title=diy href=#>#diy</a> <a title=renovation href=#>#renovation</a> <a title=home href=#>#home</a> <a title=homerenovations href=#>#homerenovations</a> <a title=homeinspo href=#>#homeinspo</a> <a title=homedecor href=#>#homedecor</a> <a title=garden href=#>#garden</a> <a title=gardening href=#>#gardening</a> <a title=kitchengarden href=#>#kitchengarden</a> <a title=pottingbench href=#>#pottingbench</a> <a title=marriage href=#>#marriage</a> <a title=marriedlife href=#>#marriedlife</a> <a title=marrige href=#>#marrige</a> <a title=marriagehumor href=#>#marriagehumor</a> <a title=marriedlifebelike href=#>#marriedlifebelike</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Crystal & Scott Ransons DIY" href=#>♬ original sound - Crystal & Scott Ransons DIY</a></figure><p>He then goes into more calculations — <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">enough to make Scott Steiner proud</a>: "So 25 ... 12 and a half plus 3/8ths, half is 4/8ths, so 12 and 7/8ths."</p><p>His wife then interjects with her own line of thinking; she picks up the metal fixture that they're looking to attach to the piece of furniture.</p><p>"Or, there's a center dot here, OK, so you go like this," she says, starting to guide her hands on the piece of furniture, and it's starting to look like she's eyeballing where the fixture is ultimately going to end up on the shelf, instead of adhering to the meticulous measurements considered by her husband.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @theransonshome</span></figure><p>"Like this center dot ... this is ... this good," she says, looking at the shelf and pointing to one corner of the piece of furniture as her husband seems perplexed by her methodology.</p><p>"This is good, this is good, OK cool," she says, placing the metal fixture to the bottom portion of the shelf.</p><p>"Is there really a centered dot?" he asks, incredulously. "Let me see," he says before she positions the fixture with an affirmation, seemingly satisfied with how it looks — "right there."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @theransonshome</span></figure><p>"Oh my gosh, let go, let go," he says, grabbing the tape measure and a marker to get as precise as possible with the fixture's placement before the video ultimately cuts out.</p><p>"His brain is just bumbers bouncing around like the DVD screen saver…" Crystal jokes in a caption for the video.</p><p>People who responded to her video in the comments section seemed to fall on one side or other of the measuring conflict: "I don't even need to watch the video to know it was perfect," one person penned.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @theransonshome</span></figure><p>However, someone else clapped back, highlighting the difference between the two modes of thought folks have whenever they're attempting to measure anything: "She was close. He was perfect. There's a difference."</p><p>Someone else said: "I would have just counted the lines on the batten board to the middle and called it good."</p><p>"It’s clearly 5 fingies wide by 7 fingies high," another user on the application joked.</p><p>There was another user on the application who argued that involving their husband in any project is a surefire way to ensure it takes longer.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @theransonshome</span></figure><p>"Project involves husband -3 hours. Project without husband -30 min lol," they wrote.</p><p>But there were folks who weren't really into the way Scott spoke to Crystal in one part of the video, like this user who penned: "'You don’t know what 3/4 divided by 2 is'? That would conclude the joint project."</p><p>One user on the app argued that there's a time and a place for in-depth calculations, and hanging a metal fixture to a cabinet isn't one of them: "I'm with the wife, I'm not about to do calculus to hang anything."</p><p>Which seemed to be a train of thought that at least one other TikToker appreciated, as they wrote: "I didn’t ask for a math lesson, I’ll do it myself."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @theransonshome</span></figure><p>Who are you siding with in this measurement battle of the sexes? Do you think that Scott was in the right and Crystal shouldn't just try to eyeball something because it's only going to leave her with a less-than-perfect outcome?</p><p>Or do you believe that Scott was being way too uptight about hanging the fixture on the shelf and that the squabble over what's getting hanged where and how it's being hanged points to some other long unaddressed issue between the couples? Did you find their argument over it to be playful?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfncK0rsCnm2auo2LEqrLEZqSemaOqv6q6xg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhusband-vs-wife-measuring.html&text=Husband%20vs%20Wife%20Measuring%20Clip%20Sparks%20Viral%20DIY%20Debate&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhusband-vs-wife-measuring.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhusband-vs-wife-measuring.html&title=Husband%20vs%20Wife%20Measuring%20Clip%20Sparks%20Viral%20DIY%20Debate" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhusband-vs-wife-measuring.html&title=Husband%20vs%20Wife%20Measuring%20Clip%20Sparks%20Viral%20DIY%20Debate" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhusband-vs-wife-measuring.html&title=Husband%20vs%20Wife%20Measuring%20Clip%20Sparks%20Viral%20DIY%20Debate" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhusband-vs-wife-measuring.html&description=Husband%20vs%20Wife%20Measuring%20Clip%20Sparks%20Viral%20DIY%20Debate" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jordan-pruitt-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jordan Pruitt - Age, Family, Bio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./fiction-books-about-female-friendships.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Celebrate Women's History Month All Year Long With These Books About Female Friendships">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
