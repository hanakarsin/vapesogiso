He refused to answer any question and only responded in syllables. He told them he was not going to do any more of their interviews. The DSS panel, in turn, said this will be their last interrogation,” a top source revealed to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>SaharaReporters</strong></a>.</p><p>Recall that during an interview with DSS officials last Wednesday, Nnamdi Kanu had revealed how he was abducted in Kenya and repatriated back to Nigeria.</p><p>“Kanu was interviewed by DSS agents today in the presence of his lawyers. He had injuries on his neck and wrist from torture. They said they didn’t know who he was. They chained him to floor for six days but they became nice to him once they found out who he was,” a top source had revealed.</p><p>Also on July 7, the IPOB leader told his lawyer that he was “mercilessly beaten and tortured” in the East African country before his extradition to Nigeria.</p><p>The lawyer had said, “There was a clear collaboration between the Kenya government and the Nigerian government and I am happy that they are now denying the fact that Kanu was arrested in there.</p><p>“But by the time we finish with them at the International Criminal Court, they will never remain the same. He was arrested at the airport there and he was taken to an unknown residence. He was subjected to inhuman treatment.</p><p>“Kanu was tortured, maltreated and mercilessly beaten, as confirmed by him to us. After spending eight days in their illegal custody, they now beckoned to the Nigerian government. Kanu was lifeless and unconscious by the time they were bringing him to Nigeria.</p><p>“To tell you the level of their conspiracy and the desperation to get him, they brought him here on a Sunday and the federal government is fully aware that I am his legal counsel.</p><p>“He was brought into the country and inflicted with several injuries and a he is having a number of medical issues today. It was at the behest of the Federal government that Kenya was doing those things. This is against all international laws. We are going to address an international court at that level.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH14e5ByZqKon5d6r7rAppuiZZuWu7Z5wqWYrKBdrLa1tIydqqxln6Wys63Toq2eq12ZwrO1zaBkoqakmr%2Bzu8aaq6KnnmQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fipob-nnamdi-kanu-clash-with-dss-operatives-during-interrogation.html&text=Nnamdi%20Kanu%20Clash%20With%20DSS%20Operatives%20During%20Interrogation&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fipob-nnamdi-kanu-clash-with-dss-operatives-during-interrogation.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fipob-nnamdi-kanu-clash-with-dss-operatives-during-interrogation.html&title=Nnamdi%20Kanu%20Clash%20With%20DSS%20Operatives%20During%20Interrogation" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fipob-nnamdi-kanu-clash-with-dss-operatives-during-interrogation.html&title=Nnamdi%20Kanu%20Clash%20With%20DSS%20Operatives%20During%20Interrogation" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fipob-nnamdi-kanu-clash-with-dss-operatives-during-interrogation.html&title=Nnamdi%20Kanu%20Clash%20With%20DSS%20Operatives%20During%20Interrogation" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fipob-nnamdi-kanu-clash-with-dss-operatives-during-interrogation.html&description=Nnamdi%20Kanu%20Clash%20With%20DSS%20Operatives%20During%20Interrogation" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./beyonce-renaissance-tour-tweets.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Beyonc Renaissance Tour Tweets  Here Are the Funniest Ones">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./why-did-archie-lose-his-teeth-leave-the-world-behind.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="In Netflix's 'Leave the World Behind' One of the Characters Leaves His Teeth Behind  Why?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
