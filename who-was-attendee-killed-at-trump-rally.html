Comperatore was a firefighter based in Pennsylvania. The husband and father of two reportedly jumped into the gunfire while trying to shield his family from the bullets before he succumbed to them himself.</p><p>"Corey was a girl dad. Corey was a firefighter," Josh Shapiro, Governor of Pennsylvania said. "Corey went to church every Sunday. Corey loved his community. Most especially, Corey loved his family."</p><p>Before Comperatore's identity was made public, a video was shared on X (formerly Twitter). The video showed CBS News reporter Jake Rosen speaking to an emergency room doctor who says he tried to save someone in the crowd who had been hurt. Please be advised that the video contains some graphic language and also what appears to be blood on the man's shirt:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>An emergency room doctor I spoke with tried to save someone’s life in the crowd <a href=#>@CBSNews</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/OJvScwRLRk</a></p>— jake rosen (@JakeMRosen) <a href=#>July 13, 2024</a></figure><p>Butler, Penn.'s authorities have stated that the shooter has been identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks.
