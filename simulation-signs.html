She sang "Baby Got Back" while people cheered and clapped and the rest of us sat there, mouths agape in horror, unsure how this is real life.</p><p>As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@OhNoSheTwint</a> wrote, "Sarah Palin on TV singing "Baby Got Back" in a bear costume to raucous applaud and laughter cutting to Trump’s statement about a deadly pandemic that he’s doing pretty much nothing about sums up present day America nicely."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Joy Behar gave out lasagnas on 'The View.'</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>EVERYBODY GETS A LASAGNA!

This can't be real life. This can't be what daytime television is in a world filled with real people. The only explanation is that we are characters in some sick lasagna-lover's game.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Jessica let her dog drink wine out of her glass on 'Love Is Blind.'</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jessica let her dog drink wine OUT OF HER GLASS on Love Is Blind and I may truly never, ever recover <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/LMRCawhPst</a></p>— Netflix US (@netflix) <a href=#>February 21, 2020</a></figure><p>Honestly, the entire season of Love Is Blind made me believe the simulation rebooted back to like, 2008. The blind dating show was a throwback to a time when we were obsessed with vapid, pretty people's drama and Nick Lachey was more relevant.&nbsp;</p><p>Obviously, Jessica was the standout villain of the show, if for no other reason than she let her golden retriever lick wine out of her glass and the went on drinking it like nothing happened. It's the wine lick heard 'round the world, at once horrifying and bold.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">A couple took 'Handmaid's Tale'-inspired wedding photos.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>A couple's "The Handmaid's Tale"-inspired wedding photograph, featuring the bride and groom kissing beside "handmaids" in red robes and white bonnets and in front of "the wall" has gone viral.

The photo went viral, garnered lots of deserved backlash, and proved that nothing is OK and we are all terrible.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The Arctic Ocean has chlamydia.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Just throwing this out there as a thing that ALSO broke me today <a href=#>https://t.co/rOWcTC1uVr</a></p>— very tired (@AlannaBennett) <a href=#>March 12, 2020</a></figure><p>There's no way to sugarcoat this: The Arctic Ocean has chlamydia.

And we all sat there in disbelief while the La La Land producers called the Moonlight team up onto the stage and handed them the statues? Yeah, well, this is just about definitive proof that our "reality" is actually a simulation.&nbsp;</p><p>In a 2017 New Yorker article called, "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Did the Oscars Just Prove That We Are Living in a Computer Simulation?</a>" Adam Gopnik writes, "Never before has there been an occasion when the entirely wrong movie was given the award, the speeches delivered, and then another movie put in its place. That doesn’t happen. Ever... We&nbsp;are&nbsp;living in the Matrix, and something has gone wrong with the controllers." That about settles that.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Dr. Phil owns this insane house.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Dr. Phil’s house looks like something I designed in SIMS when I was 13 years old <a href=#>#wtf</a> <a href=#>#DrPhilsHouse</a> <a href=#>#Sims4</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/dNRWvHv8UO</a></p>— Andrea Lopez (@AlopezComedy) <a href=#>January 3, 2020</a></figure><p>So <a href=#>Dr. Phil put his house up for sale</a> a little while ago, and the pictures truly look like they could only exist in a video game. Now, to be fair, Dr. Phil didn't live in this house — his son did. But people everywhere still flipped out because of, oh, I don't know, the vine-covered staircase? The gun room? The nightmare-inducing wall art?</p><p>There is so much about this that screams "simulation," most of all the fact that this house belonged to Dr. Phil. Yes, that Dr. Phil.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">A Utah Jazz player jokingly touched all the mics...then tested positive for the coronavirus.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz thought the NBA precautions were a joke — so he touched everything in the room.</p><p>He tested positive for coronavirus today & now the whole NBA is shut down. 😫<br><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Gdcw3WZYjj</a></p>— An0maly (@LegendaryEnergy) <a href=#>March 12, 2020</a></figure><p>The novel coronavirus has reached pandemic levels, and the way that the U.S. is handling it (or, more accurately, not handling it) would be funny if it weren't so dangerous and devastating.&nbsp;</p><p>So many headlines surrounding the story are bonkers. I've watched this video of an NBA player jokingly tapping all the mics after a press conference days before testing positive for the virus so many times. I can't wrap my head around how this is real life. You know why? Because it's not. It's a simulation.</p><p>Between this, a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">coronavirus conference being canceled for coronavirus</a>, kids <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok-ing while being tested for it</a>,&nbsp;and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson testing positive</a>, it truly feels like an elaborate prank is being played on us. As comedian <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Whitney Cummings tweeted</a>, "It’s like it picked the celebrity we cared the most about to make a point." Sure is. Puppet masters, y'all. Puppet. Masters.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">In one week, there was a full moon, a Friday the 13th, and the coronavirus was labeled a pandemic.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>In addition to the life-altering coronavirus news &nbsp;—The NBA? Canceled. Disneyland? Shut down. Employees in offices? Working from home for the foreseeable future — this week also brought us a full moon and a Friday the 13th.&nbsp;</p><p>You can't write this stuff. Seriously, like Kyra wrote, this is bad screenwriting. If I pitched this, no one would buy it. "Too on the nose," they'd say. "Unrealistic!" they'd shout. "Leave my office.
