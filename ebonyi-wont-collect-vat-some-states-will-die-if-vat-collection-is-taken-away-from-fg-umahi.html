For example, there was an issue that came up. I’m not sure it is clear to some of our colleagues on the issue of VAT but it is very clear to me.</p><p>“We (Ebonyi) took a stand as a state with our leaders on the issue of the VAT war that is going and so my deputy carried it on to say that this is what my governor is saying and this is what the state is saying and he went ahead to explain with some other deputies that represented their governors.</p><p>“But together they were in the minority and it didn’t stop the majority from coming up with their communiqué. When it comes up to implementation and voicing out, I will continue to say: this is where is I stand; if it is a choice, I will choose what would benefit my state.”</p><p>Umahi argued that the VAT war is not the right step for the governors to take in their agitation for restructuring, adding that he believes in administrative restructuring and not total restructuring.</p><p>“When they (Southern governors) say that this VAT collection is part of true restructuring, I said I never believe in total restructuring; I believe in administrative restructuring,” he said.</p><p>He added that&nbsp;“We have to be our brothers’ keeper; we have to see how we can grow the economies of the weakest states, otherwise, we will breed insecurity in those states.”</p><p>“There is no way in a relationship that you will get 100 per cent of what you put in, it doesn’t work that way.”</p><p>Umahi stated that more than 30 states including Ebonyi will not be viable if the states win the ‘VAT war’ with the federal government.</p><p>While he said he is in support of true federalism, the Governor observed that the process must be gradual</p><p>“I have said that my state would not be viable and I will continue to say that more than 30 other states would not be viable; we should not break the states.</p><p>“Whatever thing we are doing, we have to think about the nation first. Let’s tarry a while and see how we can pass this river and then we can come to the fact of who is right and who is wrong.</p><p>“True federalism is not done in a day. If we want to do a restructuring, we have to have a gradual process to do that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5BwZp6an6PGqnnWqKWtZZOkua2xwq1kr5mkYsCwucRmqq2ZpJrAbsPIpaNmnJmaeqqyjK%2BYrWWTpLmtscKtoKimXZ7AbsDApJynZZGsrrp5xaumpmWWnHq2ucChoGg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2febonyi-wont-collect-vat-some-states-will-die-if-vat-collection-is-taken-away-from-fg-umahi.html&text=Ebonyi%20Won%27t%20Collect%20VAT%2c%20Some%20States%20Will%20%27Die%27%20If%20VAT%20Collection%20Is%20Taken%20Away%20From%20FG&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2febonyi-wont-collect-vat-some-states-will-die-if-vat-collection-is-taken-away-from-fg-umahi.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2febonyi-wont-collect-vat-some-states-will-die-if-vat-collection-is-taken-away-from-fg-umahi.html&title=Ebonyi%20Won%27t%20Collect%20VAT%2c%20Some%20States%20Will%20%27Die%27%20If%20VAT%20Collection%20Is%20Taken%20Away%20From%20FG" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2febonyi-wont-collect-vat-some-states-will-die-if-vat-collection-is-taken-away-from-fg-umahi.html&title=Ebonyi%20Won%27t%20Collect%20VAT%2c%20Some%20States%20Will%20%27Die%27%20If%20VAT%20Collection%20Is%20Taken%20Away%20From%20FG" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2febonyi-wont-collect-vat-some-states-will-die-if-vat-collection-is-taken-away-from-fg-umahi.html&title=Ebonyi%20Won%27t%20Collect%20VAT%2c%20Some%20States%20Will%20%27Die%27%20If%20VAT%20Collection%20Is%20Taken%20Away%20From%20FG" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2febonyi-wont-collect-vat-some-states-will-die-if-vat-collection-is-taken-away-from-fg-umahi.html&description=Ebonyi%20Won%27t%20Collect%20VAT%2c%20Some%20States%20Will%20%27Die%27%20If%20VAT%20Collection%20Is%20Taken%20Away%20From%20FG" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./861880-jungle-justice-see-done-thieves-photos-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jungle justice: Thieves beaten brutally in Lagos, Delta states">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./boko-haram-buhari-govt-speaks-on-releasing-terrorism-financiers.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Buhari Govt Speaks On Releasing Terrorism Financiers">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
